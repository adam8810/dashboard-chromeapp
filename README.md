# Family Dashboard

This has been a project of mine for some time. Initially started as a plain website, then converted to
a Google Chromecast app, now finally a Chrome Packaged app (which I see as the last part of the evolution).
Once the project is in a more finalized state a Raspberry Pi running Linux will display this dashboard in
fullscreen.

## Current Modules
- Internal home temperatures (Using an API I created that interacts with Nest Thermostats
- Bills calendar (Using Google's Calendar API)
- Birthdays and Anniversaries (Using Google's Calendar API)
- Traffic to work (Using Google's Static Maps API + Traffic Layer)
- Movie Theater Now Playing List (Using [theMovieDb.org's API](http://theMovieDb.org)
- Weather Forecast (Using Nest's Weather APIs)
